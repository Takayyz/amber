# Cloudflare Workers

STOP. Your knowledge of Cloudflare Workers APIs and limits may be outdated. Always retrieve current documentation before any Workers, KV, R2, D1, Durable Objects, Queues, Vectorize, AI, or Agents SDK task.

## Docs

- https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/
- MCP: `https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp`

For all limits and quotas, retrieve from the product's `/platform/limits/` page. eg. `/workers/platform/limits`

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npx wrangler dev` | Local development |
| `npx wrangler deploy` | Deploy to Cloudflare |
| `npx wrangler types` | Generate TypeScript types |

Run `wrangler types` after changing bindings in wrangler.jsonc.

## Tests

`pnpm test` from the repo root. Tests live in `test/` and run on the real Workers runtime via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`.

- Use `test/helpers.ts`: `mockNetwork()` in `beforeAll`, `endOfTest` in `afterEach`, `authedRequest()` for a signed request.
- Declare every outbound call with `fetchMock`. The network is closed otherwise, so an undeclared call fails — and every declared interceptor must be used, since an unused one means a call that never happened.
- Test bindings come from `vitest.config.mts`, never from `.dev.vars`.
- `pnpm --filter api typecheck` covers both `tsconfig.json` and `test/tsconfig.json`; vitest does not type-check.

## Best Practices (conditional)

If the application uses Durable Objects or Workflows, refer to the relevant best practices:

- Durable Objects: https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/rules-of-durable-objects/
- Workflows: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/rules-of-workflows/
